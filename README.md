# Web-requests-Chat-Bot
Project for CS II class

This program basically makes call to an API and parses the data retrieved from it (using GSON library) and sends the information to a chatbot on a website.

If the user enters: "What is the weather like in Dallas, TX"
They will receive a response: "The weather in Dallas, TX is 69 degreesF, wind speed, etc..."
